                        <p>
                            If your browser is configured to accept cookies, we may collect non-personally identifiable information passively using "cookies" and "page tags".
                        </p>
                        <h4>What's a cookie?</h4>
                        <p>
                            "Cookies" are small text files that can be placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify your Web browser and the activities of your computer on the Alz-Bot Service and other websites.
                        </p>
                        <h4>What's a page tag?</h4>
                        <p>
                            "Page tags," also known as web beacons or gif tags, are a web technology used to help track website or email usage information, such as how many times a specific
                            page or email has been viewed. Page tags are invisible to you, and any portion of the Alz-Bot Service, including advertisements, or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain page tags.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Does Alz-Bot use cookies, and why?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Yes. We use cookies to personalize your experience on the Alz-Bot website, to allow us to statistically monitor how you are using the Alz-Bot Service so that we can improve our offerings,
                            and to target certain advertisements to your browser which may be of interest to you or to determine the popularity of certain content.
                            By using cookies and page tags together, we are able to improve the Alz-Bot Service and measure the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing campaigns.
                            Please be aware that this cookie policy does not govern the use of third-party websites or services or providers of third-party services.

                            You do not have to accept cookies to use the Alz-Bot Service. If you reject cookies, certain features or resources of the Alz-Bot websites may not work properly
                            or at all and you may have a degraded experience.  Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you can change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a
                            cookie or to reject cookies generally. To learn more about how to control privacy settings and cookie management, click the link for your browser below.
